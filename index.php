      </br>
      <p class="card-text">After studying drawing, painting and printmaking at Edinburgh College of Art, I completed a post graduate course at Moray House College of Education in 1982 and worked in art education for many years.</br></br>
I paint in oils, acrylics and watercolours and my subject matter includes still life, landscape, and portrait.</br>
I am also one of four artists whose watercolour illustrations feature in the book 'A Sketchbook of Edinburgh', first published in 2017 by Birlinn Ltd.</br></br>
I enjoy exploring combinations of realism and stylisation and I use a range of techniques to achieve this. Colour is a very important element in my paintings.</br>
A simplified bell jar motif is discernible in many of my compositions. This shape was inspired by a display of plant specimens I saw at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. The bell jars protect, rather than preserve, the plants while also allowing them to be clearly identified and appreciated.
I was intrigued by the idea of a symbolic bell jar protecting and highlighting a scene or group of objects which may or may not remain unchanged as time passes. Many of the still life objects I paint are old and familiar pieces whose origins I can easily identify from memory. Others, such as flowers and plants, inevitably change and wither.</br>
The ideas for my landscape painting come from the many hours my dog and I spend outside. As I walk through different landscapes I record them in drawings and photographs, and the look of the countryside in changing seasons and weather conditions is a particular inspiration to me. 
I love drawing the human form and have always enjoyed life drawing and painting. Portrait painting is a challenging, but rewarding, subject matter and I am looking forward to expanding my range of work in this area.</p>
