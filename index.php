      </br>
      <p class="card-text">After studying drawing, painting and printmaking at Edinburgh College of Art, 
        Catherine Stevenson completed a post graduate course at Moray House College of Education in 1982. 
        She worked in art education for many years while continuing to develop her own ideas and practices. 
        Her subject matter includes Still life, Landscape and Portraiture.</br>
        She is also one of four artists whose watercolour illustrations feature in the book <i>A Sketchbook of Edinburgh</i>, 
        first published in 2017 by Birlinn Ltd.

            I enjoy using a range of media and techniques to explore combinations of realism and stylisation. 
            The simplified bell jar motif originated in a display of plant specimens I saw at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. 
            The function of the bell jars is not to preserve the plants but to allow them to be clearly identified and appreciated. 
            I was intrigued by the idea of a symbolic bell jar protecting and highlighting a scene or group of objects which may or 
            may not remain unchanged as time passes. The landscape compositions are inspired by my daily walks during which I record 
            details and scenes by sketching and taking photographs. I am particularly interested in studying the colours, tones and 
            textures of the countryside at different times of day and in changing weather conditions. 
            Portrait painting is a challenging but rewarding subject and I am looking forward to expanding my range of work in this area.
