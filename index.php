			<p>Catherine works in a range of media including oil paint, acrylics and watercolour.<br/>
			In the Bell Jar series she aims to explore the theme of Time; creating carefully composed images that are both transparent and reflective, and using multiple layers of images, colour, pattern to represent both memories of the past and objects from the present.<br/>
			She has recently completed a series of watercolour illustrations which have been included in <i>A Sketchbook of Edinburgh</i> (published by Birlinn, 2017).</p>
